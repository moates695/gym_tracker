## Ideas

- muscle groups worked past 7 days (or rotation period)
- volume denoted by colour
- muscle groups worked denoted by how long since being worked
- see previous workouts
- provide list of default excercises
- allow users to and their own exercises
- provide list of default activites
- allow users to add own activities
- choose rest days
- weight graph?
- cutting, bulking, maintaining phases?
- get age, height, weight, gender for stats
- muscle distribution
    - total volume
    - number of sets
    - number of reps
    - frequency per week (or rotation period)
- stats
    - compare to age, age bracket, gender, height, weight, gym experience (or combination)
    - compare 1RM, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15 ?
    - compare weight for different sets x reps
    - compare volume, number of sets, number of reps?
- exercises
    - see maxes for sets + reps (weight may differ for each set)
    - see progression (need classification for sets x reps)
    - able to see workout history max for set x rep (choose and apply percent change +/-)
    - for body weight exercises estimate weights based on body distrubution and lever forces
- able to create workout plans
    - choose current plan
    - when workout, choose planned or swap
    - when in planned workout, allow to swap/remove exercises, allow to save as new, override current planned workout, or one off change
- drop sets, counts as one set but allow to add weights at different reps
